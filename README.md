# lanx-calc
Script for simple calculation of return times on OGame

Features:
- calculate speed, distance, travel time and return time
- supports early recall and takes interval between scans into consideration
- saves uni settings upon any changes*
- operates with server times

*saving does not work unless the script is provided write permissions, in Program Files folder this usually isn't the case so it's recommended to install the script in Documents folder
*if you still prefer the app in program files, you can manually edit preset.ini file to match your desired uni settings
